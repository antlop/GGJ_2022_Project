Current thought about "Block-Chaining-Ancestry":
	- Each class has a list of 'affecter's
	- Upon passing item along to disendant the 'affecter' is chosen and applied to the item
		- ie. the "Claymore" becomes "Brute's Claymore" and the items dmg range is increased by 2

Feature creep thought:
	- Dissownment:
		- Each item stores a queue of 'affecter's 
		- When the item is loaded up it applies the 'affecter's in order and cached
		- This provides the opportunity to 'Dissown' either a specific ancestor or a whole branch of ancestors

	- Events for Scribeable Runes:
		- Provide an scripted event or challenge 
			- ie. Make it through this gauntlet of spike traps; Kill 100 poisonous beetles in 1 life
		- Upon completion we provide the player a 'Rune' that can be passed to ancestor (without modifying it through "block-chaining")
		- Applying the 'Rune' can give the effect of the item having been passed along an extra time (with the current classes 'affecter's)
